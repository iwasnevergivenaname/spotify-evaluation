        and judging people. <br><br>

        <b>how this app uses your data:</b> by logging into your spotify account, you are allowing this app to request
    information on tracks and artists you listen to. after receiving that data, your personal information beyond your
        spotify id is not stored. the only thing i'm keeping track of is the data on the actual music itself.
        <br>
        <br>

    that data collected by spotify <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#object-audiofeaturesobject">defined by spotify:</a></p>
<dd><i>acousticness</i></dd>
<dt>a confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</dt>

<dd><i>danceability</i></dd>
<dt>danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
    rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. a value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</dt>

<dd><i>energy</i></dd>
<dt>energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. typically,
    energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. for example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores
    low on the scale. perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived
    loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
</dt>

<dd><i>speechiness</i></dd>
<dt>speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. the more exclusively speech-like the recording
    (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. values above 0.66 describe tracks that
    are probably made entirely of spoken words. values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music
    and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. values below 0.33 most likely
    represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
</dt>

<dd><i>valence</i></dd>
<dt>a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. tracks with high valence sound
    more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative
    (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
