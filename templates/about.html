<p>this app uses your spotify data (artist and tracks you've listened to) to make judgments on you</p>


<dd>acousticness</dd>
<dt>A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</dt>

<dd>danceability</dd>
<dt>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
    rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</dt>

<dd>instrumentalness</dd>
<dt>Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context.
    Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater
    likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks,
    but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.
</dt>

<dd>loudness</dd>
<dt>The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful
    for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological
    correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
</dt>

<dd>duration_ms</dd>
<dt>The duration of the track in milliseconds.</dt>

<dd>energy</dd>
<dt>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically,
    energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores
    low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived
    loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
</dt>

<dd>speechiness</dd>
<dt>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording
    (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that
    are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music
    and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely
    represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
</dt>

<dd>tempo</dd>
<dt>The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or
    pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
</dt>

<dd>valence</dd>
<dt>A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound
    more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative
    (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
